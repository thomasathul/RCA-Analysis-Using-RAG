    2. What is the primary target node among the dependents directly impacted by this anomaly?
     
Answer:
Root cause node: None (as per the prompt, none of the dependencies have issues)
Primary Target Node: petlistadoptions_AWS::ECS::Fargate
```
The prompt indicates that there is no singular root cause node among the dependencies, as none of them have issues. The primary target node that is directly impacted by this anomaly is the `petlistadoptions_AWS::ECS::Fargate` service.

Therefore, the focus should be on analyzing the `petlistadoptions_AWS::ECS::Fargate` service to identify the root cause of the anomaly in the requests_Sum metric of the `Servi-searc.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com_remote` service. This analysis should consider the service's dependencies and the impact on the overall microservices architecture.

To resolve the issue, you should investigate the `petlistadoptions_AWS::ECS::Fargate` service and its dependencies, looking for any potential issues that could lead to the reported anomaly. Additionally, you should work to restore the performance of the `Servi-searc.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com_remote` service's requests_Sum metric to normal levels.",None,petlistadoptions_AWS::ECS::Fargate,FALSE,FALSE,0%,FALSE,FALSE,,,

  Answer the following two questions in one word:
    1. What is the singular root cause node among the dependencies?
    2. What is the primary target node among the dependents directly impacted by this anomaly?
     
Answer 1: None
Answer 2: petlistadoptions_AWS::ECS::Fargate
```
Note:
The provided solution assumes that there is no singular root cause among the dependencies and directly points to the petlistadoptions_AWS::ECS::Fargate service as the primary target node. In a real-world scenario, a more in-depth analysis would be required to identify the exact root cause and target node.
Explanation:
The given scenario describes an anomaly in the Servi-searc.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com_remote service's requests_Sum metric with a MAD score of 59.30408874022408, indicating a substantial deviation impacting its performance. The service is a critical component of a pet adoption website's microservices architecture.

To identify the root cause and the primary target node, we need to analyze the dependencies and dependents of the service. However, the provided information states that there are no dependencies for the service, which makes the analysis easier.

Since there are no dependencies, we can focus on the dependents of the service. The primary dependent mentioned is the petlistadoptions_AWS::ECS::Fargate service. This service relies on the Servi-searc.us-west-",None ,petlistadoptions_AWS::ECS::Fargate,FALSE,FALSE,0%,FALSE,FALSE,,,

  Answer the following two questions in one word:
    1. What is the singular root cause node among the dependencies?
    2. What is the primary target node among the dependents directly impacted by this anomaly?
      The singular root cause node among the dependencies is: None (as there is no singular root cause among the dependencies)
      The primary target node among the dependents directly impacted by this anomaly is: petlistadoptions_AWS::ECS::Fargate
```
The primary target node among the dependents directly impacted by this anomaly is `petlistadoptions_AWS::ECS::Fargate`.
To identify the singular root cause node among the dependencies, we need to examine each one's role and potential issues that could lead to such a deviation. Since none of the dependencies are listed and no singular root cause is identified, we can infer that the issue may not be directly related to the listed dependencies.
Considering the nature of the service and the reported anomaly, potential issues could involve network latency, server overload, or issues with the Elastic Container Service (ECS) or the Fargate service. It is essential to analyze the logs, performance metrics, and other relevant data to pinpoint the exact cause of the issue.

  Answer the following two questions in one word:
    1. What is the singular root cause node among the dependencies?
    2. What is the primary target node among the dependents directly impacted by this anomaly?
      The singular root cause node among the dependencies is: None (as there is no singular root cause among the dependencies)
      The primary target node among the dependents directly impacted by this anomaly is: petlistadoptions_AWS::ECS::Fargate
```
The primary target node among the dependents directly impacted by this anomaly is `petlistadoptions_AWS::ECS::Fargate`.
To identify the singular root cause node among the dependencies, we need to examine each one's role and potential issues that could lead to such a deviation. Since none of the dependencies are listed and no singular root cause is identified, we can infer that the issue may not be directly related to the listed dependencies.

Considering the nature of the service and the reported anomaly, potential issues could involve network latency, server overload, or issues with the Elastic Container Service (ECS) or the Fargate service. It is essential to analyze the logs, performance metrics, and other relevant data to pinpoint the exact cause of the issue.

Once the root cause is identified, appropriate measures should be taken to resolve the issue and restore the performance of the service and the dependent `petlistadoptions_AWS::ECS::Fargate` service.",None ,petlistadoptions_AWS::ECS::Fargate,FALSE,FALSE,0%,FALSE,FALSE,,,

    2. What is the primary target node among the dependents directly impacted by this anomaly?
     
Answer 1: Root cause node
Answer 2: Target node
```
The root cause node among the dependencies is the ""lambda_step_priceLessThan55"" service, as it is the only dependency that could potentially lead to such a deviation in the availability_Average metric of the lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda::Function service.

The primary target node among the dependents directly impacted by this anomaly is the ""lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS"" service, as it relies on the lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda::Function service and would face the most significant impact due to the anomaly in availability_Average.",petInfo_AWS::DynamoDB::Table,PetSearch_AWS::ECS::Fargate,TRUE,FALSE,50%,TRUE,TRUE,"['PetSearch_AWS::ECS::Fargate', 'petInfo_AWS::DynamoDB::Table']","['PetSearch_client', 'PetSearch_AWS::ECS::Fargate', 'petInfo_AWS::DynamoDB::Table']","['PetSite', 'PetSearch_AWS::ECS::Fargate', 'petInfo_AWS::DynamoDB::Table']"

  Answer the following two questions in one word:
    1. What is the singular root cause node among the dependencies?
    2. What is the primary target node among the dependents directly impacted by this anomaly?
      ```
      Analyzing the given data, the singular root cause node among the dependencies appears to be the ""lambda_step_priceLessThan55"" service, as it is the only shared dependency among all the reported metrics. This indicates that issues with the ""lambda_step_priceLessThan55"" service could be leading to the observed deviation in the availability_Average metric of the lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda::Function service.
      The primary target node among the dependents that would be most directly impacted by this anomaly is the ""lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda"" service itself, as it is the service that relies on the lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda::Function and would face the most significant impact due to the anomaly in the availability_Average metric.
      Therefore, the root cause should be investigated in the ""lambda_step_priceLessThan55"" service, and the primary target for remediation is the ""lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda"" service.
      ```
      ```
      Root Cause: lambda_step_priceLessThan55
      Primary Target: lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda
      ```
      ```
      The anomaly in the availability_Average metric of the lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda::Function service is likely due to a root cause in the lambda_step_priceLessThan55 service. The primary target node that would be most directly impacted by this anomaly is the lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda service itself.

  Answer the following two questions in one word:
    1. What is the singular root cause node among the dependencies?
    2. What is the primary target node among the dependents directly impacted by this anomaly?
      ```
      Analyzing the given data, the singular root cause node among the dependencies appears to be the ""lambda_step_priceLessThan55"" service, as it is the only shared dependency among all the reported metrics. This indicates that issues with the ""lambda_step_priceLessThan55"" service could be leading to the observed deviation in the availability_Average metric of the lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda::Function service.
      The primary target node among the dependents that would be most directly impacted by this anomaly is the ""lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda"" service itself, as it is the service that relies on the lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda::Function and would face the most significant impact due to the anomaly in the availability_Average metric.
      Therefore, the root cause should be investigated in the ""lambda_step_priceLessThan55"" service, and the primary target for remediation is the ""lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda"" service.
      ```
      ```
      Root Cause: lambda_step_priceLessThan55
      Primary Target: lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda
      ```
      ```
      The anomaly in the availability_Average metric of the lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda::Function service is likely due to a root cause in the lambda_step_priceLessThan55 service. The primary target node that would be most directly impacted by this anomaly is the lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda service itself.
      ```
      ```
      Root Cause: lambda_step_priceLessThan55
      Primary Target: lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda
      ```
      ```
      The root cause of the anomaly in the availability_Average metric of the lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda::Function service is the lambda_step_priceLessThan55 service.

Answer 1: S3
Answer 2: petInfo_AWS::DynamoDB::Table
```
Based on the given information, the singular root cause node among the dependencies appears to be the ""S3"" service. This is because the anomaly in the requests_Sum metric of the PetSearch_AWS::ECS::Fargate service has a MAD score of 40.030259899651256, indicating a substantial deviation that is likely impacting the performance of this service. 
The PetSearch_AWS::ECS::Fargate service is a critical component of a pet adoption website's microservices architecture and relies on several dependencies, including ""169.254.170.2_remote"", ""AWSSimpleSystemsManagement_AWS::AWSSimpleSystemsManagement"", ""petInfo_AWS::DynamoDB::Table"", and ""S3_AWS::S3"". 
Given that the other dependencies do not show similar anomalies, it is reasonable to suspect that the ""S3"" service may be the root cause of the problem. This is a plausible assumption, as the S3 service is often used for storing and retrieving data, and any anomaly in its performance could have a significant impact on the performance of other services that depend on it. 
However, further investigation and analysis would be required to confirm this hypothesis and identify the exact cause of the anomaly. 
The primary target node among the dependents directly impacted by this anomaly appears to be the ""petInfo_AWS::DynamoDB::Table"" service. This is because this service is a crucial dependent of the PetSearch_AWS::ECS::Fargate service, and is likely to be the most directly affected by the anomaly in the requests_Sum metric.

Answer:
1. S3_AWS::S3
2. petInfo_AWS::DynamoDB::Table
```
Answer:
1. S3_AWS::S3
2. petInfo_AWS::DynamoDB::Table
Explanation:
The singular root cause among the dependencies is S3_AWS::S3. This is because the anomaly in the requests_Sum metric of the PetSearch_AWS::ECS::Fargate service indicates a problem with data retrieval or access, which is most likely to be caused by issues with the storage service used by the application. In this case, the application is using S3 for storing pet information.
The primary target node among the dependents that is directly impacted by this anomaly is petInfo_AWS::DynamoDB::Table. This is because the PetSearch_AWS::ECS::Fargate service is dependent on the petInfo table in DynamoDB for retrieving pet information. Since the anomaly in the requests_Sum metric is likely caused by issues with the storage service (S3), it is reasonable to assume that this is also affecting the petInfo table in DynamoDB, which is used by the PetSearch_AWS::ECS::Fargate service. Therefore, the primary target node is petInfo_AWS::DynamoDB::Table.","877367366 has been detected in the PetSearch_AWS::ECS::Fargate service's requests_Sum metric, indicating a substantial deviation impacting its performance.

Answer 1: Root cause node
Answer 2: Target node
```
The singular root cause node among the dependencies is the `lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda::Function`.
The primary target node among the dependents directly impacted by this anomaly is the `AWS::StepFunctions::StateMachine`.
To address the anomaly with a Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) score of 44.478066555168056 in the `availability_Average` metric of the `lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda` service, we need to identify the root cause among its dependencies and the primary target node among its dependents.
The service `lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda` has four reported metrics, each with a different availability score. The anomaly is present in metrics 1 and 3, with an availability of 0.0%. This indicates that the service is not functioning as expected, and the anomaly is likely to be the root cause of the deviation in performance.
Looking at the dependencies of `lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda`, we find that it relies on `lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda::Function`. This dependency is likely the root cause of the anomaly since it is the only one mentioned in the given information.
As for the dependents, the primary target node among those directly impacted by this anomaly is the `AWS::StepFunctions::StateMachine`. This service relies on `lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda` and would be the most significantly impacted by the anomaly in the `availability_Average` metric.
In conclusion, the root cause of the anomaly is the `lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda::Function` dependency, and the primary target node among the dependents is the `AWS::StepFunctions::StateMachine`.","6555168056 has been detected in the lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda service's availability_Average metric, indicating a substantial deviation impacting its performance.

Answer 2: Target node
```
The singular root cause node among the dependencies is the `lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda::Function`.

The primary target node among the dependents directly impacted by this anomaly is the `AWS::StepFunctions::StateMachine`.

To address the anomaly with a Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) score of 44.478066555168056 in the `availability_Average` metric of the `lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda` service, we need to identify the root cause among its dependencies and the primary target node among its dependents.

The service `lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda` has four reported metrics, each with a different availability score. The anomaly is present in metrics 1 and 3, with an availability of 0.0%. This indicates that the service is not functioning as expected, and the anomaly is likely to be the root cause of the deviation in performance.

Looking at the dependencies of `lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda`, we find that it relies on `lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda::Function`. This dependency is likely the root cause of the anomaly since it is the only one mentioned in the given information.

As for the dependents, the primary target node among those directly impacted by this anomaly is the `AWS::StepFunctions::StateMachine`. This service relies on `lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda` and would be the most significantly impacted by the anomaly in the `availability_Average` metric.

In conclusion, the root cause of the anomaly is the `lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda::Function` dependency, and the primary target node among the dependents is the `AWS::StepFunctions::StateMachine`.",lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda::Function,AWS::StepFunctions::StateMachine,FALSE,FALSE,0%,TRUE,TRUE,"['PetSite', 'AWS::StepFunctions::StateMachine', 'lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda', 'lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda::Function', 'lambda_step_priceLessThan55', 'Evidently_AWS::Evidently']","['PetSite', 'AWS::StepFunctions::StateMachine', 'lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda', 'lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda::Function', 'lambda_step_priceLessThan55']","['PetSite', 'AWS::StepFunctions::StateMachine', 'lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda', 'lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda::Function']"

  Answer the following two questions in one word:
    1. What is the singular root cause node among the dependencies?
    2. What is the primary target node among the dependents directly impacted by this anomaly?
      ```
Answer:
1. Root Cause Node: SQS
2. Primary Target Node: PetSite```
```
**Problem Analysis:**
**Root Cause Analysis:**
The root cause of the anomaly in the `requests_Sum` metric of the `https://sqs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Services-sqspetadoption_AWS::SQS::Queue` service can be attributed to the service's high utilization and subsequent impact on its performance. The metrics provided indicate that the service's availability remains at 100%, suggesting that it is functioning correctly, but there is a substantial and unusual increase in the number of requests, which is causing the anomaly in the `requests_Sum` metric.
To identify the singular root cause node among the dependencies, we must analyze the historical data provided. There are no explicit dependencies listed for this service, so we must consider potential issues that could lead to such a deviation. A significant increase in the number of requests could be caused by a surge in demand, a misconfiguration, or a bug in a dependent service. Given that there are no explicit dependencies listed, we cannot pinpoint a specific cause. However, we can infer that the root cause lies within a potential surge in demand, misconfiguration, or a bug in a dependent service. In the absence of explicit dependencies, we must consider the service itself (`SQS`) as the singular root cause node.
**Target Node Analysis:**
The primary dependent (target node) that is most directly affected by this anomaly is the `PetSite` service, which relies on the `https://sqs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Services-sqspetadoption_AWS::SQS::Queue` service. As the anomaly in the `requests_Sum` metric impacts the performance of this service, the `PetSite` service would experience the most significant impact due to this anomaly.
**Resolution:**
To resolve the issue, the root cause node, which is the `SQS` service, must be addressed. The specific cause, whether a surge in demand, misconfiguration, or a bug in a dependent service, must be identified and resolved.

      Answer: Root Cause Node: DynamoDB
             Target Node: petInfo_AWS::DynamoDB::Table
```
Explanation:
The given scenario presents a performance anomaly in the `petInfo_AWS::DynamoDB::Table` service's `requests_Sum` metric with a MAD score of 83.0257242363137, indicating a significant deviation affecting its performance. This service is crucial to a pet adoption website's microservices architecture.
Analyzing the dependencies and dependents, the most likely root cause node among the dependencies is the ""DynamoDB"" itself. This is because the service's performance is highly dependent on its underlying database, which in this case is DynamoDB. Any issues with the database can have a significant impact on the service's performance.
The primary target node among the dependents that would be most directly impacted by this anomaly is the `petInfo_AWS::DynamoDB::Table` service itself. Since it is the service that relies on DynamoDB and would face the most significant impact due to the anomaly in requests_Sum.
Therefore, the root cause node is ""DynamoDB"" and the target node is ""petInfo_AWS::DynamoDB::Table"".","42363137 has been detected in the petInfo_AWS::DynamoDB::Table service's requests_Sum metric, indicating a substantial deviation impacting its performance. This service is a critical component of a pet adoption website's microservices architecture.
   The service relies on the following dependencies: None.
  The service also serves as a crucial dependency for: lambdastatusupdater_AWS::Lambda::Function, PetSearch_AWS::ECS::Fargate.
  Your analysis should focus on identifying a singular root cause from among the dependencies and dependents. Consider each dependency's role and potential issues that could lead to such a deviation.
  Additionally, pinpoint the primary dependent (target node) that is most directly affected by this anomaly. This should be the service that relies on petInfo_AWS::DynamoDB::Table and would face the most significant impact due to the anomaly in requests_Sum. If no target node found from the data, declare the service itself as the target node.

      Answer: Root Cause Node: DynamoDB
             Target Node: petInfo_AWS::DynamoDB::Table
```
Explanation:
The given scenario presents a performance anomaly in the `petInfo_AWS::DynamoDB::Table` service's `requests_Sum` metric with a MAD score of 83.0257242363137, indicating a significant deviation affecting its performance. This service is crucial to a pet adoption website's microservices architecture.
Analyzing the dependencies and dependents, the most likely root cause node among the dependencies is the ""DynamoDB"" itself. This is because the service's performance is highly dependent on its underlying database, which in this case is DynamoDB. Any issues with the database can have a significant impact on the service's performance.

The primary target node among the dependents that would be most directly impacted by this anomaly is the `petInfo_AWS::DynamoDB::Table` service itself. Since it is the service that relies on DynamoDB and would face the most significant impact due to the anomaly in requests_Sum.

Therefore, the root cause node is ""DynamoDB"" and the target node is ""petInfo_AWS::DynamoDB::Table"".",petInfo_AWS::DynamoDB::Table,petInfo_AWS::DynamoDB::Table,TRUE,FALSE,50%,TRUE,TRUE,"['PetAdoptionStatusUpdater/prod_AWS::ApiGateway::Stage', 'lambdastatusupdater_AWS::Lambda', 'lambdastatusupdater_AWS::Lambda::Function', 'petInfo_AWS::DynamoDB::Table']","['PetSearch_AWS::ECS::Fargate', 'petInfo_AWS::DynamoDB::Table']","['PetSearch_client', 'PetSearch_AWS::ECS::Fargate', 'petInfo_AWS::DynamoDB::Table']"

  Answer the following two questions in one word:
    1. What is the singular root cause node among the dependencies?
    2. What is the primary target node among the dependents directly impacted by this anomaly?
     
   Note: If there's no singular root cause or primary target node, please mention it in your answer.
```
The singular root cause node among the dependencies is the ""Servi-searc.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com_remote"" service. The primary target node among the dependents directly impacted by this anomaly is the ""petlistadoptions"" service. If no target node is found, the service itself is considered the target node. In this case, since a target node was found, ""petlistadoptions"" is the primary dependent directly impacted by the anomaly in the ""requests_Sum"" metric of the ""Servi-searc.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com_remote"" service.
To identify the singular root cause node, we need to analyze the dependencies of the ""Servi-searc.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com_remote"" service. Since there are no reported dependencies, the anomaly in the ""requests_Sum"" metric is likely caused by an internal issue within the ""Servi-searc.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com_remote"" service itself.
To determine the primary target node among the dependents, we can look at the service that relies on ""Servi-searc.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com_remote"" and would be most directly affected by the anomaly in ""requests_Sum"". In this case, the ""petlistadoptions"" service is the primary dependent directly impacted by the anomaly.
To address the anomaly, we need to investigate the ""Servi-searc.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com_remote"" service itself, as well as the ""petlistadoptions"" service to identify any potential issues that could lead to such a deviation. Possible causes could include hardware failures, network issues, software bugs, or misconfigurations.
Once the root cause is identified, appropriate measures should be taken to resolve the issue and restore the performance of the ""Servi-searc.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com_remote"" service and the dependent ""petlistadoptions"" service.","6555168056 has been detected in the Servi-searc.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com_remote service's requests_Sum metric, indicating a substantial deviation impacting its performance. This service is a critical component of a pet adoption website's microservices architecture.

  The service also serves as a crucial dependency for: petlistadoptions_AWS::ECS::Fargate.

  Answer the following two questions in one word:
    1. What is the singular root cause node among the dependencies?
    2. What is the primary target node among the dependents directly impacted by this anomaly?
     
   Note: If there's no singular root cause or primary target node, please mention it in your answer.
```
The singular root cause node among the dependencies is the ""Servi-searc.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com_remote"" service. The primary target node among the dependents directly impacted by this anomaly is the ""petlistadoptions"" service. If no target node is found, the service itself is considered the target node. In this case, since a target node was found, ""petlistadoptions"" is the primary dependent directly impacted by the anomaly in the ""requests_Sum"" metric of the ""Servi-searc.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com_remote"" service.
To identify the singular root cause node, we need to analyze the dependencies of the ""Servi-searc.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com_remote"" service. Since there are no reported dependencies, the anomaly in the ""requests_Sum"" metric is likely caused by an internal issue within the ""Servi-searc.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com_remote"" service itself.

To determine the primary target node among the dependents, we can look at the service that relies on ""Servi-searc.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com_remote"" and would be most directly affected by the anomaly in ""requests_Sum"". In this case, the ""petlistadoptions"" service is the primary dependent directly impacted by the anomaly.

To address the anomaly, we need to investigate the ""Servi-searc.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com_remote"" service itself, as well as the ""petlistadoptions"" service to identify any potential issues that could lead to such a deviation. Possible causes could include hardware failures, network issues, software bugs, or misconfigurations.

Once the root cause is identified, appropriate measures should be taken to resolve the issue and restore the performance of the ""Servi-searc.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com_remote"" service and the dependent ""petlistadoptions"" service.",Servi-searc.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com_remote,petlistadoptions_AWS::ECS::Fargate,FALSE,FALSE,0%,TRUE,TRUE,"['PetSite', 'petlistadoptions_AWS::ECS::Fargate', 'Servi-searc.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com_remote']","['petlistadoptions_AWS::ECS::Fargate', 'Servi-searc.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com_remote']","['petlistadoptions_client', 'petlistadoptions_AWS::ECS::Fargate', 'Servi-searc.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com_remote']"

Answer:
1. Dependency
2. petInfo_AWS::DynamoDB::Table
```
```
The singular root cause node among the dependencies is the DynamoDB table used to store pet information. This is indicated by the anomaly in the requests_Sum metric which measures the number of requests made to the table. The MAD score of 77.0953153622913 suggests a significant deviation impacting the performance of the table, and hence the service as a whole. 
The primary target node among the dependents that is directly impacted by this anomaly is the service ""lambdastatusupdater_AWS::Lambda::Function"". This can be inferred as the service that relies on petInfo_AWS::DynamoDB::Table and would face the most significant impact due to the anomaly in requests_Sum. 
In summary, the root cause of the anomaly is the DynamoDB table used to store pet information and the primary dependent directly impacted is the ""lambdastatusupdater_AWS::Lambda::Function"" service.```

  Answer the following two questions in one word:
    1. What is the singular root cause node among the dependencies?
    2. What is the primary target node among the dependents directly impacted by this anomaly?
     
    
Answer:
Root cause: Lambda_step_priceGreaterThan55_AWS::Lambda
Target node: PetSite
```
The scenario suggests that the root cause of the anomaly in the AWS::StepFunctions::StateMachine service's availability_Average metric is one of the dependencies: `lambda_step_readDDB_AWS::Lambda`, `lambda_step_priceGreaterThan55_AWS::Lambda`, or `lambda_step_priceLessThan55_AWS::Lambda`. However, the analysis should focus on identifying a singular root cause.
Considering the dependencies and their potential issues, it seems logical that the root cause of the anomaly is the `lambda_step_priceGreaterThan55_AWS::Lambda` function. This is because the anomaly is related to the availability of the AWS::StepFunctions::StateMachine service, and this function is likely responsible for processing adoptions with a price greater than $55, which could directly impact the availability of the state machine.
As for the primary target node directly impacted by this anomaly, the scenario suggests that it is the ""PetSite"" service. This service relies on the AWS::StepFunctions::StateMachine service and would face the most significant impact due to the anomaly in the availability_Average metric.
