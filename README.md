# RCA-Analysis-Using-RAG

This project leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to enhance root cause analysis (RCA) in complex systems. By integrating a retrieval mechanism with a generative Large Language model, the system efficiently identifies root cause nodes based on relevant external data, providing context-aware and accurate diagnoses. The RAG-based approach improves traditional RCA methods by handling large datasets and complex interdependencies more effectively.

## Key Features:
* **Retriever Module**: Fetches relevant data related to previous system issues.
* **Generator Module**: Processes retrieved information to generate coherent root cause analyses.
* **Data Augmentation**: Enhances training set with synthetic data for better generalization.
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Precision, recall, F1-score, Matthews's correlation coefficient and Cosine Similarity to measure model effectiveness.
## Objectives:
* Develop a RAG-based architecture for accurate root cause identification.
* Enhance RCA identification by integrating relevant external knowledge.
* Provide comprehensive evaluation results through tables and graphical plots.
## Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the potential of RAG architecture in RCA, aiming to improve system reliability and performance through accurate and context-aware root cause identifications.
